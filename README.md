# React_Crypto_Tracking

Hello world!! This project, is a _crypto currency tracker app_,it is powered by **React.js, MaterialUI, and Chartjs**. The data is fetched from the [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) API, making use of **Axios**.

In this app, the user can visualized the top 100 Cryptos by market cap, with a pagination of 10 currencies per page. Also, a search bar is deployed so the user can search and filter the tokens by either name or symbol _(example: Bitcoin or BTC)_. A `carousel` is displayed at the top of the home page, where infinetly are looped the tokens with recent changes in their prices. The user can view the prices of the tokens expressed in EUR or USD.

Another cool and major functionality is the view of the price chart of any of the tokens from the last day, last month, last 3 months or last year. I have to thanks ~~`@piyush-eon~~` and his helpfull repository for this great shared knowledge.

**MaterialUI** components where use to structure the page and for the navigation **React-Router-Dom**, for its simple and intuitive way of working.

## Current Functionality

- Select a token and jump to the specific crypto page information, where the user can view more details about it, included the Chart of prices in the last day, month, quarter or year.
